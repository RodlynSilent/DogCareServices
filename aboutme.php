			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Hello and welcome to my website! My name is asdhelp, a 2nd-year BSIT student,
			currently focused on my studies while also trying to make the most out of my university experience. 
			</p>
			<p>I am passionate about myself but I can also be mean if being tempted by my surroundings.
			Being in my late teens, I'm at a stage in my life where I'm discovering who I am and what I want to achieve in life.
			As a result, I'm eager to explore new experiences and opportunities that will help me grow both academically and personally.
			</p>
			<p>I'm also working part-time to help support myself financially while pursuing my studies.
			Overall, I'm a hardworking and ambitious individual who is eager to learn and grow as I pursue my academic and personal goals.
